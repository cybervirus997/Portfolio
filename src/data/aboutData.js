    description1: "I fell in love with coding while writing my first program in Python.I was first introduced to coding in school where I learnt C++. But at that point, I was more fascinated by electronic bots which lead me to pursue my Bachelor's and Master's in Electronics.But my drive to learn new things made me stumble upon Python tutorial videos during the 2020 lockdown, and since then there has been no going back. I found my passion in web development. I have learnt various tech stack to build many projects.
